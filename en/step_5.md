## Challenge: Improved jumping

Your character is able to jump whenever the spacebar is pressed, even if they're already in mid-air. You can test this by just holding down the spacebar. Can you fix this, so that your character can only jump `if`{:class="blockcontrol"} they're touching a blue platform?
