## Introduction

In this project you'll learn how to create a platform game, in which you have to dodge the moving balls and reach the end of the level.

## Introduction:
In this project, children will learn how to make a platform game, making use of Scratch concepts and skills that have been learnt in previous projects.

## Resources
For this project, Scratch 2 should be used. Scratch 2 can either be used online at [jumpto.cc/scratch-on](http://jumpto.cc/scratch-on) or can be downloaded from [jumpto.cc/scratch-off](http://jumpto.cc/scratch-off) and used offline.

The 'Project Materials' link for this project contains the following resources:

##### Club leader Resources

You can find a completed version of this project <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/39740618/#editor">online</a>, or it can be downloaded by clicking the 'Project Materials' link for this project, which contains:

+ Dodgeball.sb2

##### Project Resources

For this project, club members can make use of external resources that aren't available in the Scratch library:

+ background.png.

For club members that aren't able to access these project resources, there is a Scratch project with the external resources pre-loaded. This is available online at [jumpto.cc/dodge-resources](http://jumpto.cc/dodge-resources), or in the downloadable project materials, which contains:

+ DodgeballResources.sb2 

## Learning Objectives
+ This project consolidates learning of previous programming skills learnt.

This project covers elements from the following strands of the [Raspberry Pi Digital Making Curriculum](http://rpf.io/curriculum):

+ [Combine programming constructs to solve a problem.](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/programming/builder)

## Challenges
+ "Improved jumping" - using an additional `if`{:class="blockcontrol"} block to fix a multiple-jump bug;
+ "Random balls" - using the `random`{:class="blockoperators"} block to vary the ball costume, size and delay between clones;
+ "More obstacles" - adding additional sprites to the game;
+ "Improved gravity" - using an additional `if`{:class="blockcontrol"} block to fix a bug in the `gravity`{:class="blockdata"};
+ "More lives" - addition of a `lives`{:class="blockdata"} variable.
