## Challenge: More lives

Can you give your player 3 `lives`{:class="blockdata"}, instead of just sending them back to the beginning each time? Here's how your game could work:

+ Your player starts with 3 lives;
+ Whenever your player gets hit, one life is lost and they go back to the start;
+ If there are no lives left, the game ends.
